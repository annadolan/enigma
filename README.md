##ENIGMA

The goal of this project is to write code for an encryption algorithm that shifts letters
based on a random 5-digit key and an offset derived from the date. Additionally, the goal
is to crack the code based on the final characters of any input being "..end..".

This code enables the user to encrypt a message from a text file to another text file,
and decypher or crack the encrypted text and write the result to another file. The "Enigma"
class can also be run through a Pry session, taking various numbers of arguments for each
method.
